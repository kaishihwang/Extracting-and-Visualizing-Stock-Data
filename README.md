## Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data
To analyze and compare the price trends of Tesla and GameStop, I extracted the historical stock and revenue data for both companies. By examining this data, I am able to build dashboards that visualize and compare stock prices and revenue trends.
After making the graphs, I will get the following charts with sharing price and revenue of both Tesla and GameStop.
